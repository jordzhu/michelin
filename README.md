All 2020 Michelin Restaurants, mapped

The current Michelin guide is inaccurate and difficult to use. The markers on the map jump around when you move: https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/new-york-state/restaurants?showMap=true

This map gives an easy way to locate all Michelin Guide 2020 restaurants in NYC, along with filters for Michelin distinction and cost.

Yelp uses this guide:

$: Under $10<br/>
$$: $11-30<br/>
$$$: $31-60<br/>
$$$$: $61+

This is for NYC, so under $10 basically limits you to Chinese takeout, Halal cart, or deli food. Instead, I am using the following:

$: Under $15<br/>
$$: $16-50<br/>
$$$: $51-80<br/>
$$$$: $81+
