All 2020 Michelin Restaurants, mapped

The current Michelin guide is inaccurate and difficult to use. The markers on the map jump around when you move: https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/new-york-state/restaurants?showMap=true

This map gives an easy way to locate all Michelin Guide 2020 restaurants in NYC.

Yelp uses this guide:

$: Under $10
$$: $11-30
$$$: $31-60
$$$$: $61+

This is for NYC, so under $10 basically limits you to Chinese takeout, Halal cart, or deli food. Instead, I am using the following:

$: Under $15
$$: $16-50
$$$: $51-80
$$$$: $81+
